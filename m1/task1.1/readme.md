    * Branching - the "develop" branch was divided into two: "images" and "styles", in which work was carried out and files modifications took place:  
    ![Screen2](./task_images/Screenshot_3.png)
    * Merging branches - merge developments from two independent branches "images" and "styles" into a "develop" branch:  
    ![Screen3](./task_images/Screenshot_4.png)
    * Resolution of merge conflicts that occur in case of discrepancy of files with the same name, which were modified in parallel branches:
