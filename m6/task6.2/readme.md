# Task 6.2 Configuring DHCP, DNS servers and dynamic routing using OSPF protocol  

1. Testing virtual network was configured as shown on the figure 1:  
![Screen1](./task_images/Screenshot_1.png)  
VM1 has NAT and internal network connections, VM2 and VM3 â€“ internal only interfaces.  

2. Installation and configuration of DHCP server on VM1.  
###   **Case 1:** Using ISC-DHCP-SERVER:  
 - **isc-dhcp-server** installation:  _**apt install isc-dhcp-server**_.  
 - Editing config **/etc/default/isc-dhcp-server**:  
 ![Screen2](./task_images/Screenshot_2.png)  
 - Editing config **/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf** (previously copied to **/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf.backup**):  
 ![Screen3](./task_images/Screenshot_3.png)  
 - starting of **isc-dhcp-server**:  
 ![Screen4](./task_images/Screenshot_4.png)  
 - Change interface config on VM2 and VM3 to get network settings via dhcp and check result:  
 ![Screen5](./task_images/Screenshot_5.png)  
 ![Screen6](./task_images/Screenshot_6.png)  

###   **Case 2:** Using DNSMASQ:  
 - **dnsmasq** installation:  _**apt install dnsmasq**_.  
 - Editing config **/etc/default/isc-dhcp-server**:  
 ![Screen7](./task_images/Screenshot_7.png)  
 - Starting **dnsmasq**:  
 ![Screen8](./task_images/Screenshot_8.png)  

3. Check VM2 and VM3 for obtaining network addresses from DHCP server:  
 - Changing interface config on VM3 to get network settings via DHCP (on VM2 it was done earlier):  
 ![Screen9](./task_images/Screenshot_9.png)  
 - Checking results:

 ![Screen11](./task_images/Screenshot_11.png)  
 ![Screen12](./task_images/Screenshot_12.png)  

4. Using existed network for three VMs (from p.1) install and configure DNS server on VM1. (You can use DNSMASQ, BIND9 or something else).  
 - **DNSMASQ** was used to configure DNS:  
 ![Screen13](./task_images/Screenshot_13.png)  
 - Separate file resolv.dnsmasq.conf was created, because original symbolic link (_**resolv.conf -> ../run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf**_) becomes unworking after service **systemd-resolved** was disabled and OS reboot:  
 ![Screen13a](./task_images/Screenshot_13a.png)  
 - **DNSMASQ** working principles:  
 ![Scheme](./task_images/dnsmasq-01.png)  

5. Check VM2 and VM3 for gaining access to DNS server (naming services):  
 - **VM2:**  
 ![Screen14](./task_images/Screenshot_14.png)  
 ![Screen15](./task_images/Screenshot_15.png)  
 - **VM3:**  
 ![Screen16](./task_images/Screenshot_16.png)  

6. Using the scheme which follows, configure dynamic routing using OSPF protocol:  
 ![Screen](./task_images/ospf.png)  
 **VM1**:  
 - **Quagga** installed, enabled. **Ospfd** enabled, all other services (protocol daemons like **bgpd**, **ripd**, **isisd** etc.) disabled. Log directory and log files created, rights configured (3):  
 ![Screen17](./task_images/Screenshot_17.png)  
 - **/etc/sysctl.conf** configuration made, as described in (4):  
 ![Screen18](./task_images/Screenshot_18.png)  
 - **/etc/quagga/zebra.conf** configuration made, as described in (4):  
 ![Screen19](./task_images/Screenshot_19.png)  
 - Further configuration of **ospfd** (**/etc/quagga/ospfd.conf**) made according to (5) via **ospf** CLI:  
 ![Screen20](./task_images/Screenshot_20.png)  

 **VM3**:  
 - **Quagga** installed, enabled. **Ospfd** enabled, all other services (protocol daemons like **bgpd**, **ripd**, **isisd** etc.) disabled. Log directory and log files created, rights configured (3) - all like on VM1.
 - **/etc/sysctl.conf** configuration made, as described in (4) - all like on VM1.  
 - **/etc/quagga/zebra.conf** configuration made, as described in (4):  
 ![Screen21](./task_images/Screenshot_21.png)  
 - Further configuration of **ospfd** (**/etc/quagga/ospfd.conf**) made according to (5) via **ospf** CLI:  
 ![Screen22](./task_images/Screenshot_22.png)  

 **Checking results:**  
 - We can see the packet changing process between VM1 and VM3 with **tcpdump -nvi any proto ospf** command:  
 ![Screen23](./task_images/Screenshot_23.png)  
 - Also can see routes in VM1's routing table, which were got from VM3 via OSPF routing protocol:  
 ![Screen24](./task_images/Screenshot_24.png)  
 ![Screen25](./task_images/Screenshot_25.png)  

 **P.S.:**  
 To avoid situation of two default routes in VM3's routing table, adding of **redistribute connected** instead **default-information originate** in the **/etc/quagga/ospfd.conf** on VM1 to notify neighbors about connected networks only and don't transmit as a default route:
